# DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER 

## ABOUT DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIERS :-

A differential amplifer amplifies the difference between two input voltage also by rejecting thr common voltage shared by the input

## WORKNG :
Basically it has 2 input terminals v1 and v2
from the output terminal we can get  Vout = gain(v1-v2)
                                      Vout = gain (vd)
                     where , vd= v1-v2

Question : Design and analyse the different amplifier forthe given  specification

Vpp= 2.2V ; P <= 2.2mw ; Vincm =1.2V ; Vocm = 1.25V Vp = 0.4V simulate the following also extract DC , transient , frequency respinse parameter
