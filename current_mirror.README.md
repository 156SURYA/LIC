# CURRENT MIRROR EXPERIMENT 

### Introduction to Current Mirroring Circuits in Linear Integrated Circuits :-

A current mirror circuit is a crucial building block in linear integrated circuits (LICs) used to copy or replicate a reference current from one branch of a circuit to another. It ensures that the mirrored current remains stable and independent of variations in voltage or temperature, making it highly useful in analog circuit design.
Current mirrors are widely used in applications such as biasing, active loads, current amplification, voltage regulators, and analog signal processing. These circuits utilize transistors (BJTs or MOSFETs) to produce an output current that is either equal to or a scaled version of the reference current.
